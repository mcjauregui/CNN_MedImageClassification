Medical Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks  

Overview and Purpose  
In this document, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model from scratch to classify CT chest scan images as either cancerous or normal, and then investigate the added benefit of using a pre-trained CNN model on the same dataset by employing transfer learning and model ensembling.

Convolutional Neural Network: General Overview  
CNNs use convolutional and pooling layers to automatically and hierarchically learn features from images, followed by fully connected layers to classify those features into predefined categories. This process enables CNNs to effectively handle and classify complex visual data.
